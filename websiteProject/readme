Welcome to my Full Stack Development Project!

This project is currently in its early stages, but stay tuned! I'll be integrating backend features and adding more cool stuff soon.

Through this project, I've acquired practical experience in web programming, utilizing technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

Additionally, I've sharpened my skills in deploying websites using tools and platforms such as Linux Ubuntu, FileZilla, and DigitalOcean.

Thanks for checking it out, and keep an eye out for updates!
